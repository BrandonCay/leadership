# leadership
This project is to investigate and measure leadership practices in online software development communities.  

Specifically, we are interested in exploring data-driven evidences to understand the following questions: What constitutes leadership in a virtual environment (leadership can be a temporary positioning rather than a stable role)? 2.	How do people emerge as leaders in an issue/task/community? What role does diversity play in virtual teams? Does the virtual software development environment eliminate any racial/gender biases or does it perpetuate them? 

Methodology: 
- establish/refine codebook for identifying leadership practices based on manual labelling
- manual label to establish ground truth
- train classifiers
- evaluate performance of initial classifier
- impact analysis

Currently, we are focusing on establishing codebook from issue discussion records in the Blockchain project. We plan to extend to other projects in the future.
